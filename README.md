<h1 align="left">Hi, I’m Adam</h1>

<p>
I’m a computer science student at KTH.
</p>

<p>
I like building software, especially projects that involve data, optimization, and a bit of machine learning.
I enjoy working hands-on and following ideas all the way from early experiments to something that actually runs.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, I’m working on tools for transport data, both systems for managing and optimizing it,
and models for cleaning and correcting messy inputs.
</p>

<p>
I’m also interested in biotechnology and biomedicine, particularly how computation and AI can be used in areas
like gene editing, CRISPR, and biological data analysis.
</p>

<p>
If you want to collaborate or talk about ideas, feel free to reach out.
